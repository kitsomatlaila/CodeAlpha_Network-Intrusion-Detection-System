Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) - CodeAlpha Internship Task 4

 Project Overview
This project is a web-based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) dashboard created as part of the CodeAlpha cybersecurity internship program. The dashboard simulates the functionality of real-world NIDS tools like Snort or Suricata, providing an interactive interface for monitoring network traffic, detecting threats, and managing security rules.

 Task Requirements:
 <br>
This implementation addresses Task 4 of the CodeAlpha cybersecurity internship:
<br>

Set up a network-based intrusion detection system using tools like Snort or Suricata
Configure rules and alerts to detect suspicious or malicious activity
Monitor network traffic continuously for potential threats
Implement response mechanisms for detected intrusions
Visualize detected attacks using dashboards or graphs

Features:
<br>
Live Network Monitoring
Real-time visualization of network traffic with animated nodes and connections
Color-coded traffic indicators showing normal vs. suspicious activity
Live statistics on packets per second, active threats, and bandwidth usage

Threat Detection & Alerting
Real-time security alerts with severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
Alert details including source/destination IPs, attack types, and timestamps
Simulated detection of various attack types (SQL injection, port scanning, malware, etc.)

 Rule Management:
 <br>
Interactive rule system with enable/disable functionality
Example Snort-style rules for common attack patterns
Rule editing capabilities for customization

 Visualization Dashboard:
 <br>
Clean, professional UI with intuitive navigation
Statistical overview cards showing threat levels and system status
Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices

 Configuration Interface
 <br>
Settings panels for different aspects of NIDS configuration

Options for detection modes, alert settings, and response actions

 Technical Implementation
Frontend Technologies
HTML5: Page structure and content
CSS3: Styling with custom properties and responsive design
JavaScript: Interactive functionality and dynamic content
Canvas API: Network traffic visualization

Key Components:
<br>
